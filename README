This is a fairly simple bell system using a usb-to-serial converter
and triac circuit. A PHP web UI creates an XML file that a C++ daemon
will read and turn on the bell if it is time to ring the bell. For
more info, see the website.

Depends:
	glibc
	libxml++

Web UI uses (included):
	http://fancybox.net/
	http://javascriptcalendar.org/
